# openUC2 GOSH Hackathon

Welcome to the openUC2 GOSH Hackathon! This hackathon is dedicated to pushing the limits of what modular optics can do. We are excited to have you join us at the Lichtwerkstatt in Jena on 14th July at 13:00 CET. Get ready for an incredible hacking experience!

## Important Information

- **Date**: 14th July
- **Time**: 13:00 CET
- **Location**: Lichtwerkstatt, Jena
- **Duration**: Until 13:00 the next day

A more detailed email with additional information, including what to bring and important links, will be sent to you in the next few days. In addition, we will set up a dedicated GitHub page with the latest updates. Stay tuned for further instructions!

## Hackathon Projects

We have selected some exciting projects that we will be working on during the hackathon:

1. **BluFocus** - A bluray player-based autofocusing system for microscopes. Check out the project repository [here](https://github.com/openUC2/openUC2-Hackathon-BluFocus).

2. **HistoScanner** - An open-source slide scanning system for histological slides using ImSwitch and ASHLAR. This project aims to improve plant-oriented imaging. Visit the project repository [here](https://github.com/openUC2/openUC2-Hackathon-HistoScanner).

3. **openOCT** - An open-source optical coherence tomography setup that can be controlled remotely using the TwinLab. Find the project repository [here](https://github.com/openUC2/openUC2-Hackathon-openOCTRemote).

4. **CassetteSampler (Optional)** - This project involves cassette-based sample handling using the ESPressoscopes. Explore the project repository [here](https://github.com/openUC2/openUC2-Hackathon-SampleRecorder) and the ESPressoscopes [here](https://matchboxscope.github.io/).

We will provide documentation and updates for these projects on our GitHub Pages, which are currently under construction. You will find four partially working setups controlled by our ImSwitchUC2 Fork in combination with the UC2-ESP32 firmware and the UC2-REST control library. More information will be shared during on-site and online workshops. Visit our website [here](https://openuc2.github.io) for further details.
